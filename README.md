As an end-user, we will create a ticket explaining that our entire mobile/online banking system is down. This would likely be a critical outage as it is the entire system.

We can then log into osTicket as a help desk agent, we will be using "John" to view the ticket in the system. Please review the ticket's properties (Priority, department, SLA, Assigned To).

Now observe the ticket once more as "John", as you can see since it has been assigned over to Online Banking we are now unable to edit the ticket further.

We can now log in with "Jane" in the online banking department to complete the ticket. In this example, we say that there has been a failure in the recent update to the online banking system website and it has to be rolled back so the website can work properly.

The ticket can now be closed with the issue resolved!
